% dict_img = create_dictionary_image(C, atom_seq_vec, discard_dc_flag, ...
%   grid_line_color, normalize_patch_flag)
%
% Creates an image of the (not necessarily orthogonal) dictionary C of
% which each atom (column) is visualized as a square patch arranged on a
% (square) grid. The number of rows of matrix C (dimensionality) has to be 
% a square number. By default, each patch is normalized for visualization,
% i.e., its mean value is subtracted, subsequently the patch is scaled to 
% unit supremum norm, and finally the resulting patch range [-1, 1] is 
% mapped to the gray value interval [0, 1] (by shifting and scaling).
%
% INPUT:
% ======
% C (required):
%   dictionary (num_dims x num_atoms)
%
% atom_seq_vec (optional, default: 1:num_atoms):
%   index sequence that defines the order of atom patches in the dictionary
%   image. atom_seq_vec should be a permutation of 1:num_atoms. The patches
%   will be arranged on the grid in a "column major" fashion.
%
% discard_dc_flag (optional, default: false):
%   if true, the atom of C that is closest to the dc component is
%   identified. The corresponding patch is only shifted by the average gray
%   value (0.5) and not further processed. Each column of C is assumed to
%   have unit length.
%
% grid_line_color (optional, default: 1):
%   defines the color of grid lines between the patches; possible values
%   are: 0 (black), 1 (red), 2 (green) or 3 (blue)
% 
% normalize_patch_flag (optional, default: true)
%   if true, patches are allowed to be normalized, i.e., modified for
%   visualization purpose (see function normalize_patch)
%
% OUTPUT:
% =======
% dict_img:
%   image of the dictionary. Each atom is represented by a suare patch. The
%   atom patches are ordered in a "column major" fashion according to 
%   atom_seq_vec.
