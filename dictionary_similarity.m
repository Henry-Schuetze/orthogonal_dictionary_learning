% [sim_vec, match_atoms_vec] = dictionary_similarity(C, C_ref)
%
% Computes the overlaps between "matching columns" of matrix C and matrix 
% C_ref. The matching is assigned as a bijective mapping based on 1st, 2nd,
% 3rd, ... largest overlap. The columns of C and C_ref should all have unit
% length.
%
% INPUT:
% ======
% C (required):
%   dictionary (num_dims x num_atoms)
%
% C_ref (required):
%   reference dictionary (num_dims x num_atoms)
%
% OUTPUT:
% =======
% sim_vec:
%   similarity vector (num_atoms x 1) containing the overlaps of matched
%   atom pairs
%
% match_atoms_vec:
%   row vector that matches the columns of matrix C to those of C_ref.
%   defines column permutation of matrix C such that a column
%   C(:, match_atoms_vec(col_idx)) matches with column C_ref(:, col_idx)
