% [X, A] = create_synthetic_data_set(C, num_samples, sparsity_param, ...
%   synthetic_mode)
%
% Creates a synthetic dataset of sparse samples, where each sample is 
% linearly combined by some small subset of atoms of the (not necessarily 
% orthogonal) dictionary C. The locations of non-zero coefficients are
% selected uniformly at random. The non-zero coefficients are drawn (i.i.d)
% from a standard Gaussian distribution.
%
% INPUT:
% ======
% C (required):
%   dictionary (num_dims x num_atoms)
%
% num_samples (required):
%   number of desired samples (columns of data matrix X) to be generated
%
% sparsity_param (required):
%   sparsity parameter corresponding to the synthetic mode (if
%   synthetic_mode == 'column_k-sparse' it defines for each sample the 
%   exact number of non-zero coefficients, if synthetic_mode ==
%   'bernoulli_gaussian' it defines the probability of a coefficient to be
%   non-zero which is sparsity_param/num_atoms)
%
% synthetic_mode (required):
%   a string with value either 'column_k-sparse' or 'bernoulli_gaussian' 
%   selecting the synthetic mode
%
% OUTPUT:
% =======
% X:
%   data matrix (num_dims x num_samples)
%
% A:
%   sparse coefficient matrix (num_atoms x num_samples) by which the data 
%   matrix X is synthesized
