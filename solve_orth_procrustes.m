% U = solve_orth_procrustes(M)
%
% Solves the orthogonal procrustes problem, a matrix approximation problem
% which asks for the orthogonal matrix U which is nearest to a given matrix
% M in terms of the Frobenius metric. If M = A'B, then the problem can be 
% equivalently formulated as follows:  U = arg min_W ||WA - B||_F subject 
% to W'W = I.

% INPUT:
% ======
% M (required):
%   a matrix whose number of columns does not exceed it number of rows
%
% OUTPUT:
% =======
% U:
%   matrix with same size as M and mutually orthogonal columns.
%   Furthermore, U is closest to M in terms of the Frobenius metric
