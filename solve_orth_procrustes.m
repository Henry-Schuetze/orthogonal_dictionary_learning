% U = solve_orth_procrustes(M)
%
% Solves the orthogonal procrustes problem, a matrix approximation problem
% which asks for the orthogonal matrix U which is nearest to a given matrix
% M in terms of Frobenius metric. Assuming M = A'B, it can be equivalently 
% formulated as follows:  U = arg min_W ||WA - B||_F subject to W'W = I.
